Script-Daemonizer
=================
Turns your script into a UNIX daemon process (the easy way).


DESCRIPTION
===========

This module is born out of the need to easyly turn pre-existing scripts into 
daemons. It's inspired by the behaviour of well known daemons such as named or 
(x)inetd, and provides these capabilities: 

- daemonizing (go to background, detach from terminal, close open files, 
  chdir to /, set umask to 0);
- drop privileges;
- write a pidfile and use it for locking (single-instance daemons);
- redirect to syslog or log4perl all messages sent to STDOUT and STDERR;
- restart the process on-demand.

It's meant to be easy, but also customizable in its behaviour.

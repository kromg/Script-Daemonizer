=head1 ABSTRACT

This module turns your script into a UNIX daemon by requiring as little
modification as possible, thus letting you concentrate on solving 
your problem, rather than on writing a daemon. Just get your job done, then 
turn your script into a daemon by calling daemonize(). 

It tries to redirect all messages to syslog by default, using Tie::Syslog.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

daemonize() is the main routine of this module. What it does, out-of-the-box,
is: 

=over 4

=item 1.* it sets umask() to 0. You must then set explicitly file and 
directory permissions upon creating them, restore umask() after initialization,
or specify I<umask> option (see L</ADVANCED USAGE> for details).

=item 2.* it calls fork(), then the parent exits;

=item 3.  it calls POSIX::setsid() (see L<POSIX::setsid()>), so the process becomes session leader;

=item 4.* it calls fork() again, then the parent exits; 

=item 5.* it changes its working directory to "/";

=item 6.* NO LONGER IMPLEMENTED (since 0.93.00) - closing file descriptors
It's practically impossible, so this step has been removed. 

=item 7.* it ties STDOUT and STDERR to Syslog using  C<Tie::Syslog> (if
available, otherwise it reopens them on /dev/null) so that all output is 
logged to syslog (see L<Tie::Syslog>); open STDIN on /dev/null.

=back

Steps marked by * are configurable; some additional steps are also available if
explicitly requested; see L</ADVANCED USAGE> for details.


=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Creates a new instance of a Script::Daemonizer object. If you just want to start
with defaults, just call it with no args: 

    # A new daemon
    my $daemon = new Script::Daemonizer ();

    # or, if you prefer:
    my $daemon = Script::Daemonizer->new();

To customize your daemon see L</ADVANCED USAGE>.


=head2 daemonize()

It runs through all the steps required to send your program to background as a
daemon. Its behavior can be customized a little, see L</ADVANCED USAGE> for
details.

=head2 drop_privileges()

    # Just drop effective user/group id:
    $daemon->drop_privileges(
        euid => $to_euid,
        egid => $to_egid,
    );

    # Drop both effective and real ids: 
    $daemon->drop_privileges(
        uid  => $to_uid,
        gid  => $to_gid,
    );

Tries to drop privileges to given EUID/EGID or UID/GID (single (e)uid/(e)gid
allowed).
See L<perldoc perlvar> for details on IDs. 

daemonize() will automatically call drop_privileges() if configured to do so
(guess what? See L</ADVANCED USAGE> for details) but this will happen 
B<before> anything else (think of this as step 0). If you need to drop
privileges at a later moment, use drop_privileges(), otherwise it's probably
safer to do so while daemonize()-ing. 

=head2 restart()

restart() is there to let you restart completely the daemon. A simple way to
handle SIGHUP might be restarting, for example (see 
L<perlipc|http://perldoc.perl.org/perlipc.html#Handling-the-SIGHUP-Signal-in-Daemons>
for details). 

    # Restart upon sighup - use a closure to call restart()
    $SIG{HUP} = sub {
        $daemon->restart;
    }; 

B<pidfile> (see L</ADVANCED USAGE> for details) is kept open 
upon restart (if configured), but on some platforms (see L</Concerning locks>
for details) the lock is not preserved, so a race condition may still happen. 

You can pass command line args to restart() to modify command line on-the-fly: 

    use Script::Daemonizer;
    ...
    unless( some_condition_on(@ARGV) ) {
        # Do some mangling to @ARGV
        ...
        $daemon->restart(@my_modified_argv);
    }

The defaul is to use a copy of @ARGV taken at compile-time (before any
command-line-parsing modifies @ARGV, for example). 

=head2 sigunmask()

    $daemon->sigunmask( @signals );

Strictly related to restart(), sigunmask() is there to let you unmask signals
without pain. See L<http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/perl4/cook/ch17_19.htm>
for details on why you should unmask signals. In short: inside a signal handler
the signal that triggered the handler is blocked. If inside a signal handler you
re-exec() yourself, the new process inherits the blocked signal. That is why you
could want to unmask that signal after a new start. 

B<SGIHUP is unmasked by default>, just by saying C<use Script::Daemonizer>. 

If you use restart() with other signals, remember to unmask them: 

    # Restart on SIGHUP, SIGQUIT and SIGUSR1
    for my $nal in (qw/HUP QUIT USR1/) {
        $SIG{$nal} = sub {
            $daemon->restart;
        }
    }

    # Just in case we came from another instance of ourselves via an exec()
    # (no need to bother for SIGHUP since we unmask it by default, anyway
    # listing it here it's harmless): 

    $daemon->sigunmask(qw{QUIT USR1});


=head1 ADVANCED USAGE

I strive to make this module support "standard" daemon features
out-of-the-box (for some definition of "standard"). Some of these features can
be configured, and some other are enabled only if configured. 

=head2 ADVANCED SYNOPSYS

Advanced configuration syntax is the following: 

    use Script::Daemonizer;
    my $daemon = new Script::Daemonizer (
        name            => "My wonderful new daemon",  # tag for logging
        umask           => $my_umask,                  # set umask to $my_umask
        working_dir     => "/var/ftp",                 # try to chdir here
        drop_privileges => {                           # call drop_privileges()
            uid  => $to_uid,
            gid  => $to_gid,
        },
        do_not_tie_stdhandles => 1,                    # skip tie-to-syslog
        fork            => 2,                          # for # number of times (0, 1 or 2)
        pidfile         => '/var/run/mydaemon.pid',    # write and lock this pidfile
    );

    

=head2 OPTIONAL ACTIONS

Some options have no default and thus corresponding actions are skipped if not
configured. These are: 

=over 4

=item * Step 0.0 - privileges dropping

It happens before anything else. This simply calls drop_privileges() internally. 

=item * Step 0.1 - pidfile creation (and locking)

This implicitly provides a method to ensure that only one copy of your daemon 
is running at once, because pidfile is locked. PID is written into pidfile only
after the last fork() has been completed. 

=item * Handling of SIGHUP as a restart()

You must set up restart() as the handler of SIGHUP yourself. See 
L</restart()> for details.

=item * Unmaksing signals

If you use signals other than SIGHUP for restarting, remember to sigunmask()
them (see L</sigunmaks()> for details).

=back


=head2 ADVANCED OPTIONS

Advanced options are the following: 

=head3 B<name>

Sets the name of the daemon. This is used for logging. 

I<default>: script name, got from $0, split on system path separator;

=head3 B<do_not_tie_stdhandles> 

Define this to close STDOUT/STDERR and reopen them from /dev/null.

Default is to tie STDOUT and STDERR with to facility LOG_DAEMON, priorities
LOG_INFO and LOG_ERR, logopt 'pid,ndely' (see L<Tie::Syslog> for details).

I<default>: C<undef> - tie stdhandles so that output will go to syslog.

=head3 B<pidfile>

This will try to:

=over 4

=item - open named pidfile, creating it if non-existent;

=item - lock it (exclusively);

=back

If this operation fails, daemonize() will croak(). Otherwise, PID of the process
will be written to the named pidfile after the last fork() is done. 

    Script::Daemonizer::daemonize(
        name    => 'A new daemon',
        pidfile => '/var/run/anewdaemon.pid',
    );

This lock mechanism provides the following advantages:

=over 4

=item * no other instances of the same daemon will overwrite the pidfile on
purpose;

=item * the pid file will serve as a lock file, ensuring no other instances of
the same daemon will start;

=item * an C<fuser> (see L<fuser(1)>) on the pidfile will reveal the daemon's pid. If 
the daemon is not running, the pidfile will not be in use by any process 
(hopefully). A simple: 

    $ fuser -k $PIDFILE

will end up killing the daemon (or provides an easy way to signal the daemon).

=back

=head3 B<umask>

Set the specified umask.

default: 0

=head3 B<working_dir>

Try to chdir() to the specified directory.

default: root (/) dir.

=head2 LOCKING

If you want to be sure no multiple instances of your daemon will be running,
just use I<pidfile> advanced option. See L</pidfile> for details.


=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 Concerning filehandles

Filehandles cannot really be closed. Following advice from Matt S. Trout I will
skip filehandle-closing step completely. 


=head2 Concerning locks

On some platforms (FreeBSD, Mac OS X, OpenBSD, Solaris) the lock on the pidfile
is not preserved across fork(), so from 0.91 to 0.92 I added a second flock()
after the last fork(). This allows a race condition between the first and the
second flock(), but it should not be a problem, since the lock could be as well
tried just after the last fork(). The reason I left the first attempt in place
is that if we have to fail anyway, it's better to do it as early as possible. 
B<The real race condition> may happen, instead, when the process is restarted
using restart() (or by any other mean), because if lock on pidfile is not
preserved, someone could take the lock on it before we're able to complete
restart, thus causing the process to exit. 



=head1 FAQ

=head2 Q: Why is there no built-in start/stop/* method? 

A: Because to start/stop/* a daemon you usually don't call the daemon itself,
instead you rely on system tools that allow process control (if you need an S<<
"init script" >> then write one) and interact with processes through signals.
Lack of start/stop/* methods is regarded as a feature. Try L<Daemon::Control> if
you're searching for such an interface.

=head2 Q: Why is Tie::Syslog not listed as prerequisites? 

A: Because you may want to skip Syslog support and not install that
module. Script::Daemonizer module will work nonetheless, without using
Tie::Syslog them (and without the features it provides, of course).


=head1 TODO

Some ideas: 

=over 4 

=item * Let user set her own options for tied STDOUT/STDERR (i.e. logopt for
syslog (see L<Sys::Syslog>), facility, priority).

=item * Provide a function to automatically parse command line (via
L<Getopt::Long|Getopt::Long>).

=item * Provide a function to automatically handle configuration file (via 
L<Config::General|Config::General>).
